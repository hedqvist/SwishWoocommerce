== DESCRIPTION ==

Swish Gateway is a plugin that extends WooCommerce with a Swish payment gateway.se

When the order is passed to Klarna a credit record of the customer is made. If the check turns out all right, Klarna creates an invoice/order in their system. After you (as the merchant) completes the order in WooCommerce, the invoice/order can be automatically activated in Klarnas system.

Klarna is a great payment alternative for merchants and customers in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.
